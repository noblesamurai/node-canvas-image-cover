# Canvas-image-cover [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/noblesamurai/canvas-image-cover.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/noblesamurai/canvas-image-cover) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/canvas-image-cover.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/canvas-image-cover)

> Cover a canvas with an image given a locked centre point and zoom factor.

## Purpose

Kind of provides a canvas equivalent of the CSS [background-size:
cover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size?v=example#cover).

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install canvas-image-cover
```

## Usage

```js
const cover = require('canvas-cover-image');
const Canvas = require('canvas');
const Image = Canvas.Image;
const canvas = new Canvas(640, 480);
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const img;

fs.readFile(__dirname + '/images/squid.png', function(err, squid){
  if (err) throw err;
  img = new Image;
  img.src = squid;

  // to fit the image to the canvas at the best possible size.
  cover(img, 0, 0, 200, 200).render(ctx);

  // to fit and zoom in by a factor of 2
  cover(img, 0, 0, 200, 200).zoom(2).render(ctx);

  // to fit and zoom into the top left corner of the image
  cover(img, 0, 0, 200, 200).zoom(0, 0).pan(0, 0).render(ctx);

  // to pan to the left side and then zoom into the top right corner of that
  // left side...
  cover(img, 0, 0, 200, 200).pan(0, 0).crop().zoom(2).pan(1, 0);

  // and other more complicated things...
});
```

### Example of how multiple levels of zoom and pan work

## API

## Cover

```js
const cover = require('canvas-image-cover');
cover(img, x, y, width, height);
```
Provides a mechanism to draw an image in canvas such that it will cover the area provided exactly.


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| img | <code>Canvas.Image</code> | the image to render |
| x | <code>number</code> | offset x coordinate on the canvas |
| y | <code>number</code> | offset y coordinate on the canvas |
| width | <code>number</code> | width to fit to on the canvas |
| height | <code>number</code> | height to fit to on the canvas |

## Chainable modifiers:

All the following functions will return the same `Cover` object as the `cover()` function so they can be chained together.

### Crop

```js
cover(img, x, y, width, height).crop();
```
Doesn't actually crop the input image but does redefine the bounds of the image for the sake of panning. ie. after a crop, the pan cx and cy will be with regard to the currently defined area rather than the whole image or previously cropped area.

### Pan

```
cover(img, x, y, width, height).pan(cx, cy);
```
Change the center point of the image.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cx | <code>number</code> | value between 0 and 1 representing the left or right   side of the image bounds. The bounds will be the whole image or the   defined source area at the time of the last crop(). |
| cy | <code>number</code> | value between 0 and 1 representing the top or the   bottom of the image bounds. |

### Zoom

```js
cover(img, x, y, width, height).zoom(factor);
```
Zoom in at the current location.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| factor | <code>number</code> | how much to zoom in by (>=1). |

### Render

```js
cover(img, x, y, width, height).render(ctx);
```
Render to the provided context.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ctx | <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> | canvas context to render to |

Note: The `Cover` object returned by all the above functions contains the source x, y, width, height values used to do the rendering so if you only want the numbers and you don't actually need to render to the canvas you can retrieve them from that object.

```js
let { sx, sy, sw, sh } = cover(img, x, y, width, height).zoom(2);
```
